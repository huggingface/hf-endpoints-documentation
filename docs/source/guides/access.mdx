# Access 🤗 Inference Endpoints

To access the [🤗 Inference Endpoints web application](https://ui.endpoints.huggingface.co/), you need to be a user or an organization with an active plan. There are currently two plans available:

- **Pay as you go** based on your hourly compute, and billed monthly. This plan can be as low as $0.06 per CPU core/hr and $0.6 per GPU/hr depending on your needs.
- **Enterprise** pricing is custom and based on volume commit and annual contracts. In addition, you'll also receive dedicated support, 24/7 SLAs, and uptime guarantees.

If you are not sure if your organization or user has an active plan you can try to access the [web application](https://ui.endpoints.huggingface.co/). If you don't have an active plan you will see an unauthorized page with similar instructions as shown below.

To add the **Pay as you go** plan to your organization:

1. Go to the upgrade page

You can upgrade your organization following here:  https://huggingface.co/subscribe/lab

2. Select the organization you want to upgrade and click 'next'.

<Tip>
  
If you don't see your organization it means you already have a plan!
