# Update your Endpoint

You can update `running` Endpoints to change some of the configurations. However, if your endpoint is in a `failed` state, you need to create a new Endpoint.

Currently, only the instance size and autoscaling options can be updated and we are working on adding support for task type and revision as well.

## Instance size 

You can update the instance size of your Endpoint in the Endpoint overview menu to match your evolving needs. For example, you can downsize to a smaller instance type if you don't need the compute or alternatively, you can upgrade to a larger instance type if you need to increase your compute.

You're only allowed to update your *current* instance type, CPU or GPU. In other words, you can't update from one instance type to another (CPU to GPU or vice versa).

## Autoscaling

You can update the autoscaling configuration of your Endpoint in the Endpoint overview menu. Adjust the minimum and maximum number of replicas to upscale or downscale your Endpoint.
