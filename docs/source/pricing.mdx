Easily deploy machine learning models on dedicated infrastructure with ðŸ¤— Inference Endpoints. When you create an Endpoint, you can select the instance type to deploy and scale your model according to an hourly rate. ðŸ¤— Inference Endpoints is accessible to Hugging Face accounts with an active subscription and credit card on file. At the end of the subscription period, the user or organization account will be charged for the compute resources used while Endpoints are *initializing* and in a *running* state.

You can find the hourly pricing for all available instances for ðŸ¤— Inference Endpoints, and examples of how costs are calculated below. While the prices are shown by the hour, the actual cost is calculated by the minute.

## CPU Instances

The table below shows currently available CPU instances and their hourly pricing. If the instance type cannot be selected in the application, you need to [request a quota](mailto:api-enterprise@huggingface.co?subject=Quota%20increase%20HF%20Endpoints&body=Hello,%0D%0A%0D%0AI%20would%20like%20to%20request%20access/quota%20increase%20for%20{INSTANCE%20TYPE}%20for%20the%20following%20account%20{HF%20ACCOUNT}.) to use it.

## Pricing examples

The following example pricing scenarios demonstrate how costs are calculated. You can find the hourly rate for all instance types and sizes in the tables above. Use the following formula to calculate the costs:

```
instance hourly rate * ((hours * # min replica) + (scale-up hrs * # additional replicas))
```

### Basic Endpoint

* AWS CPU medium (2 x 4GB vCPUs)
* Autoscaling (minimum 1 replica, maximum 1 replica)

**hourly cost**
```
instance hourly rate * (hours * # min replica) = hourly cost
$0.12/hr * (1hr * 1 replica) = $0.12/hr
```

**monthly cost**
```
instance hourly rate * (hours * # min replica) = monthly cost
$0.12/hr * (730hr * 1 replica) = $87.6/month
```

### Advanced Endpoint

* AWS GPU small (1 x 14GB GPU)
* Autoscaling (minimum 1 replica, maximum 3 replica), every hour a spike in traffic scales the Endpoint from 1 to 3 replicas for 15 minutes

**hourly cost**
```
instance hourly rate * ((hours * # min replica) + (scale-up hrs * # additional replicas)) = hourly cost
$0.6/hr * ((1hr * 1 replica) + (0.25hr * 2 replicas)) = $0.9/hr
```

**monthly cost**
```
instance hourly rate * ((hours * # min replica) + (scale-up hrs * # additional replicas)) = monthly cost
$0.6/hr * ((730hr * 1 replica) + (182.5hr * 2 replicas)) = $657/month
```
