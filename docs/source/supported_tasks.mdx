# Supported Transformers Tasks

Below is a table of Hugging Face managed supported tasks for Inference Endpoint. These tasks don't require any form of code or [“custom container”](/docs/inference-endpoints/guides/docs/guides/custom_container) to deploy an Endpoint. 
If you want to customize any of the tasks below, or want to write your own custom task, check out the [“Create your own inference handler”](/docs/inference-endpoints/guides/docs/guides/custom_handler) section for more information.

You can add additional parameters, which are supported by the `pipelines` api from transformers. 

For Example if you have a `text-generation` pipeline you can provide `generation_kwargs` for `repetition_penalty` or `max_length`

```json
{
  "inputs": "Hugging Face, the winner of VentureBeat’s Innovation in Natural Language Process/Understanding Award for 2021, is looking to level the playing field. The team, launched by Clément Delangue and Julien Chaumond in 2016, was recognized for its work in democratizing NLP, the global market value for which is expected to hit $35.1 billion by 2026. This week, Google’s former head of Ethical AI Margaret Mitchell joined the team.",
  "parameters": {
    "repetition_penalty": 4.0,
