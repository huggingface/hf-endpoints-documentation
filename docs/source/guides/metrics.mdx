Hugging Face Endpoints provides access to the metrics and analytics of your Endpoints through the UI on the detailed overview in the “Analytics” tab of your Endpoints.

## Access Metrics via API

The Hugging Face Inference Endpoints API exposes a [route to access the metrics](/docs/inference-endpoints/api_reference#getendpointmetrics) of your Endpoints. You can use this route to send customized Prometheus queries to your Endpoints.

### Pending requests - new!

Pending requests are requests that don't have a response status yet. We now display analytics on requests that have been sent to your model, but are still being processed.
