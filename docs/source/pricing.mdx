# Pricing

When you create an Endpoint, you can select the instance type to deploy and scale your model according to an hourly rate.
Inference Endpoints is accessible to Hugging Face accounts with an active subscription and credit card on file. At
the end of the billing period, the user or organization account will be charged for the compute resources used while
successfully deployed Endpoints (ready to serve) are *initializing* and in a *running* state.

Below, you can find the hourly pricing for all available instances and accelerators, and examples of how costs are calculated:
While the prices are shown by the hour, the actual cost is calculated by the minute.

## CPU Instances

The table below shows currently available CPU instances and their hourly pricing. If the instance type cannot be selected in the application, you need to [request a quota](mailto:api-enterprise@huggingface.co?subject=Quota%20increase%20HF%20Endpoints&body=Hello,%0D%0A%0D%0AI%20would%20like%20to%20request%20access/quota%20increase%20for%20[INSTANCE%20TYPE]%20for%20the%20following%20account%20[HF%20ACCOUNT].) to use it.

## Pricing examples

The following example pricing scenarios demonstrate how costs are calculated. You can find the hourly rate for all instance types and sizes in the tables above. Use the following formula to calculate the costs:

```
instance hourly rate * ((hours * # min replica) + (scale-up hrs * # additional replicas))
```

### Basic Endpoint

* AWS CPU intel-spr x2 (2x vCPUs 4GB RAM)
* Autoscaling (minimum 1 replica, maximum 1 replica)

**hourly cost**
```
instance hourly rate * (hours * # min replica) = hourly cost
$0.067/hr * (1hr * 1 replica) = $0.067/hr
```

**monthly cost**
```
instance hourly rate * (hours * # min replica) = monthly cost
$0.064/hr * (730hr * 1 replica) = $46.72/month
```

### Advanced Endpoint

* AWS GPU small (1x GPU 14GB RAM)
* Autoscaling (minimum 1 replica, maximum 3 replica), every hour a spike in traffic scales the Endpoint from 1 to 3 replicas for 15 minutes

**hourly cost**
```
instance hourly rate * ((hours * # min replica) + (scale-up hrs * # additional replicas)) = hourly cost
$0.5/hr * ((1hr * 1 replica) + (0.25hr * 2 replicas)) = $0.75/hr
```

**monthly cost**
```
instance hourly rate * ((hours * # min replica) + (scale-up hrs * # additional replicas)) = monthly cost
$0.5/hr * ((730hr * 1 replica) + (182.5hr * 2 replicas)) = $547.5/month
```
