# Text Embeddings Inference (TEI)

Text Embeddings Inference (TEI) is a robust, production-ready engine designed for fast and efficient generation of text
embeddings from a wide range of transformer models. Built for scalability and reliability, TEI streamlines the deployment
of embedding models for search, retrieval, clustering, and semantic understanding tasks.

Key Features:
- **Efficient Resource Utilization**: Benefit from small Docker images and rapid boot times.
- **Dynamic Batching**: TEI incorporates token-based dynamic batching thus optimizing resource utilization during inference.
- **Optimized Inference**: TEI leverages Flash Attention, Candle, and cuBLASLt by using optimized transformers code for inference.
- **Support for models** in both the Safetensors and ONNX format
- **Production-Ready**: TEI supports distributed tracing through Open Telemetry and exports Prometheus metrics.
