# Access and view Metrics

Hugging Face Endpoints provides access to the metrics and analytics of your Endpoints through the UI on the detailed overview in the “Analytics” tab of your Endpoints.

## Pending requests

Pending requests are requests that don't have a response status yet. We now display analytics on requests that have been sent to your model, but are still being processed.

## Access Metrics via API

The Hugging Face Inference Endpoints API exposes a [route to access the metrics](/docs/inference-endpoints/api_reference#getendpointmetrics) of your Endpoints. You can use this route to send customized Prometheus queries to your Endpoints.
